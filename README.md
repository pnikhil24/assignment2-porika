Goa is Located on the **Western Ghats of Konkan**, Goa is known as the smallest and the fourth smallest populated state of India. Goa is bounded by Maharashtra to its north, eastern and southern boundaries were formed by Karnataka, while the western coast is formed by **Arabian Sea**.<br> I like it because it helps me to refresh, last time when i visited the place had good time and enjoyed alot.
